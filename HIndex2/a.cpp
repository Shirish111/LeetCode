// H-Index II

// Given an array of citations sorted in ascending order (each citation is a
// non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the
// researcher's h-index.

// According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h
// if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and the other N âˆ’ h
// papers have no more than h citations each."

// Example:

// Input: citations = [0,1,3,5,6]
// Output: 3
// Explanation: [0,1,3,5,6] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each
// of them had
//              received 0, 1, 3, 5, 6 citations respectively.
//              Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each
//              and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, her
//              h-index is 3.
// Note:

// If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the
// h-index.

// Follow up:

// This is a follow up problem to H-Index, where citations is now guaranteed to
// be sorted in ascending order. Could you solve it in logarithmic time
// complexity?
